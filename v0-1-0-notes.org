* Forcing function
+ find a textbook example to reproduce in a test
+ first layer only
+ first layer has arrows out but not in
+ subsequent layers can have arrows out and in
+ user provides input of shape either (n_compartments,) or (n_layers, 2, n_compartments)
+ former case: tc from ff comp to other comps; there is no xfer in/out of this compartment in subsequent layers
+ latter case: for each layer, first row is arrows out; second row is arrows in (zeros for first layer)
+ the ff is represented in the model as an additional compartment
+ ff is compatible with prelayer, but user cannot provide a prelayer tac for it
+ solver must skip over ff compartment for the first layer

* Voiding / elution
+ write a test first
+ solve in intervals and adjust initial conditions
+ specify void times and (layer,compartment) tuples
+ can supply more than 1, but not for the same layer,compartment tuple
